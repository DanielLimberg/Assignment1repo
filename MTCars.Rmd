knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(Hmisc) # some useful functions
library(utils) # for downloading stuff from the internet

## Data

This data is from Motor Trend magazine in 1974. 

1. Data overview
```{r summary mtcars}
?mtcars

summary(mtcars)

dim(mtcars) # The first number is the number of rows in the data frame and the second is the number of columns.

names(mtcars)


```
2. Exploring the variables
```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
stat.desc(mtcars@mpg, basic=false) # summary stats for variables of interest
```

## Plots

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am,levels=c(0,1),
   labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))
qplot(mtcars$am, mtcars$mpg, geom = "boxplot", main = "MPG by Transmission Type", xlab = "Transmission", ylab = "MPG")

boxplot(mtcars@mpg, color="green") # creating boxplots

wvioplot(mtcars@mpg, color="green", names="Speed") # creating boxplots

```
